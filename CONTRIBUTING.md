Thank you for your interest in the Awesome Yarn project! Before making a contribution, please take a minute to read these guidelines.

If you have any questions about the project or these guidelines, [open an issue](https://github.com/samantha-uk/awesome-yarn/issues).

Most importantly, **enjoy yourself!** Donâ€™t take this project _too_ seriously. While it is (*hopefully*) useful, there are more important things in life than some arbitrary list of links.
