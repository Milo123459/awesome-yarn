A curated list of awesome resources, libraries and tools for Yarn Berry (v2+).

## Yarn Berry
* Documentation can be viewed on the Yarn website [here](https://yarnpkg.com/).
## Plugins
Plugins are key to the modular architecture of Yarn Berry. Many plugins are "core" and included in the initial installation. There are also a number of "official" plugins available on the Yarn [site](https://yarnpkg.com/features/plugins) to extend the capabilites of Yarn.

And (_as you'd expect_) there are Awesome third party plugins:

### Build Tools
* [Yarn Build](https://yarn.build/) - BUILD and BUNDLE your local workspaces. It's like Bazel, Buck and Pants but for Yarn.

* [Yarn Bump](https://github.com/cometkim/yarn-plugin-bump) - Bump all dependencies in one simple command.
